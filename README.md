# Red Raven

Red Raven was my final school project for the Web Design course. I really admire Edgar Allan Poe, so i choose to dedicate this project to him. As this was my first real web project, the code itself probably is not quite good, but I do intend to fix it and make it cleaner.

Domain name redraven.com is just for testing purposes, this website were hosted on my school's server. The whole design was mine including the logo (which is available under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International") License), but pictures were actually taken from [Poestories.com](http://poestories.com/) and Google.
