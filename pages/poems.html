		<h1>Eldorado (1849)</h1> </br>
 <pre>
	GAILY bedight,
				 A gallant knight,
	In sunshine and in shadow,
				 Had journeyed long,
				 Singing a song,
	In search of Eldorado.

				 But he grew old --
				 This knight so bold --
	And o'er his heart a shadow
				 Fell as he found
				 No spot of ground
	That looked like Eldorado.

				 And, as his strength
				 Failed him at length,
	He met a pilgrim shadow --
				 "Shadow," said he,
				 "Where can it be --
	This land of Eldorado?"

				 "Over the Mountains
				 Of the Moon,
	Down the Valley of the Shadow,
				 Ride, boldly ride,"
				 The shade replied, --
	"If you seek for Eldorado!"

		<h1>Annabel Lee (1849)</h1> </br>
	<pre>
		It was many and many a year ago,
	   In a kingdom by the sea,
	That a maiden there lived whom you may know
	   By the name of ANNABEL LEE;--
	And this maiden she lived with no other thought
	   Than to love and be loved by me.
	She was a child and I was a child,
	   In this kingdom by the sea,
	But we loved with a love that was more than love--
	   I and my Annabel Lee--
	With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
	   Coveted her and me.

	And this was the reason that, long ago,
	   In this kingdom by the sea,
	A wind blew out of a cloud by night
	   Chilling my Annabel Lee;
	So that her high-born kinsman came
	   And bore her away from me,
	To shut her up in a sepulchre
	   In this kingdom by the sea.

	The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
	   Went envying her and me:--
	Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,
	   In this kingdom by the sea)
	That the wind came out of a cloud, chilling
	   And killing my Annabel Lee.

	But our love it was stronger by far than the love
	   Of those who were older than we--
	   Of many far wiser than we-
	And neither the angels in Heaven above,
	   Nor the demons down under the sea,
	Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
	   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:--

	For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
	   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
	And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
	   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
	And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
	Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
	   In her sepulchre there by the sea--
	   In her tomb by the side of the sea.
